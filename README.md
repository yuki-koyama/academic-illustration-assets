# academic-illustration-assets

Assets for creating illustrative figures (and video figures) released under CC0 (public domain)

## Background

I have published several papers in the computer graphics and human-computer interaction domains. For creating the figures, video figures, and presentation slides of those papers, I repeatedly reused several common assets (such as `pointer.ai` for illustrating GUI interactions). However, every time I tried to do this, I needed to salvage those assets from old projects.

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to improve the reusability of my assets for accelerating future projects.

## Design Principles

### Colors

- Black: `#231F20`
- Accent: `#CE6B68`

### Illustrators (`*.ai`)

- Color mode: RGB
- Units: Pixels
- PDF compatible file

### After Effects (`*.aep`)

- 29.97 fps
